## Description
This code is an HTML and JavaScript implementation that creates a simple animation of two eyes following the movement of the mouse cursor. The HTML structure defines the layout of the eyes, while the JavaScript code enables the dynamic behavior.

## How to Run
To run this code, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new directory on your computer to hold the project files.
2. In the newly created directory, create an HTML file and open it with a text editor.
3. Copy the provided code (from the original code snippet) into the HTML file.
4. Save the HTML file with a `.html` extension, for example, `index.html`.
5. Create a CSS file named `styles.css` in the same directory as the HTML file.
6. In the CSS file, define the styles for the eyes and balls to customize their appearance.
7. Create a JavaScript file named `eyes.js` in the same directory as the HTML file.
8. In the JavaScript file, copy the provided code (from the original code snippet).
9. Open the HTML file in a web browser.

Once the HTML file is open in the browser, you should see two eyes on the screen. Move your mouse cursor within the browser window, and the eyes will follow its movement.

## Customization
You can customize the appearance and behavior of the eyes by modifying the CSS and JavaScript files.

### CSS (styles.css)
In the CSS file, you can adjust the styles of the eyes and balls by modifying the classes `.eyes`, `.eye`, and `.ball`. Update the CSS properties such as color, size, border, or background to achieve the desired visual effect.

### JavaScript (eyes.js)
In the JavaScript file, you can modify the behavior of the eyes by editing the code inside the `document.onmousemove` event handler. Currently, the code calculates the position of the mouse cursor relative to the window and updates the position of the balls accordingly. You can add additional logic or effects to enhance the eye animation.

## Roadmap for Future Improvements
Here are some possible improvements for the code:

1. Implement blinking animation to make the eyes more realistic and lifelike.
2. Add interactivity by allowing users to click on the eyes or perform other actions.
3. Create different eye designs or allow users to choose from a selection.
4. Improve responsiveness for different screen sizes and devices.
5. Integrate with a backend to fetch dynamic data that influences the eye movement.
6. Provide options for users to customize the eye animation parameters.

Feel free to contribute to the project by implementing any of these improvements or coming up with your own ideas. Pull requests are welcome!
