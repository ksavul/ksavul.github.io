# PacMen Exercise

## Description
Pacmen is a JavaScript project that allows you to create and control multiple Pacman images on a web page. The project provides a factory function to create Pacman objects, positions them on the screen, and allows them to bounce off the walls.

## How to Run
To use the Pacmen project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have the Pacman image files (e.g., "PacMan1.png") in the same directory as the HTML file.
3. Open the HTML file (`starter.html`) in a web browser.

## Usage
1. Press the "Make one" button to create a new Pacman. This will position the Pacman image randomly on the screen and add it to the "game" div.
2. As you create more Pacmen, each one will be added to the array of Pacmen, which keeps track of their position and velocity.
3. The Pacmen will move on their own, bouncing off the walls whenever they hit them.

## Customization
You can customize the Pacmen project by modifying the following aspects:
- Pacman images: Replace the existing Pacman image (`PacMan1.png`) with your own Pacman image files. Make sure to update the image source in the code accordingly.
- Pacman behavior: Adjust the velocity and movement logic in the JavaScript code to change how the Pacmen move and interact with the walls.

## Roadmap for Improvements
Here are some potential improvements that can be made to the Pacmen project:

1. **User Interaction**: Implement user interaction features, such as allowing users to control the movement of Pacmen using keyboard or mouse input.
2. **Power-ups and Ghosts**: Introduce power-up items that Pacmen can collect to gain special abilities or score bonuses. Additionally, add ghost enemies that Pacmen need to avoid.
3. **Levels and Challenges**: Create multiple levels with increasing difficulty, each with unique layouts, obstacles, and objectives for the Pacmen to complete.
4. **Scoring and High Scores**: Implement a scoring system to keep track of points earned by Pacmen. Add a high score leaderboard to encourage competition among players.
5. **Animations and Visual Effects**: Enhance the visual appeal of the Pacmen project by adding animations, particle effects, and sound effects for actions like eating, colliding, or reaching specific milestones.
6. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize the project for mobile devices by adapting the layout and controls to provide an enjoyable experience on smartphones and tablets.
7. **Multiplayer Support**: Enable multiplayer functionality, allowing multiple players to control Pacmen simultaneously and compete or cooperate within the same game session.
8. **Advanced AI**: Implement intelligent AI-controlled Pacmen or computer-controlled opponents with dynamic strategies and behavior patterns.

These improvements can be implemented gradually to enhance the gameplay and provide a more engaging experience for users.
